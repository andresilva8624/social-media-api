# Social Network API


![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AndreGitHub-MIT-green.svg)

The goal of the project is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. The walkthrough video attached demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met in Insomnia. Enjoy! ðŸ˜€
